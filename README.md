# EDS214 Group Project
## Team Killer Whales: Jillian Allison, Andrew Bartnik, Kiran Favre, Michelle Lam, Dalila Lara


## Introduction
This project is focused on developing collaborative workflow skills through two exercises. The first goal was to create a concentration time series for the stream water chemistry data collected at four research sites at the Luquillo Experimental Forest. The data was read in, processed, and visualized on the Taylor server. The second goal was to ask and answer a question related to the data. 


## Installation
To succesfully repdroduce our project, access to the Taylor server at Bren is required. 

Access to the data used can be found on the Environmental Data Initiative site here: McDowell, W. 2022. Chemistry of stream water from the Luquillo Mountains ver 4923058. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/1dd1a59a7e6fbe95fdf8736477d81b83

## Usage

## Contribute 
### Fixing bugs
### Github/pull requests (?)
To collaborate effectively, a Github repository was made and cloned to the Taylor Server at Bren. We used pair programming and worked together to find solutions to the answser the questions being asked.
