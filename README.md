## Introduction
This project is focused on developing collaborative workflow skills through two exercises. The first goal was to create a concentration time series for the stream water chemistry data collected at four research sites at the Luquillo Experimental Forest. This data is collected by the Long Term Ecological Network and hosted by the Environmental Data Initiative. The data was read in, processed, and visualized on the Taylor server. The second goal was to ask and answer a question related to the data collected through the LTER. We decided to explore the same nutrients as our first exercise, Nitrate and Potassium, across other sites.

To collaborate effectively, a Github repository was made and cloned to the Taylor Server at Bren. We used pair programming and worked together to find solutions to the answser the questions being asked. We also set up a Slack channel to share information. 


## Installation
To succesfully repdroduce our project, access to the Taylor server at Bren is required. 
The packages tidyverse, lubridate, and patchwork must be loaded before the code provided is used. 

Access to the data used can be found on the Environmental Data Initiative site here: McDowell, W. 2022. Chemistry of stream water from the Luquillo Mountains ver 4923058. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/1dd1a59a7e6fbe95fdf8736477d81b83


## Usage
This project can be used in the future to monitor individual nutrient concentrations in this area. 

## Contribute 
### Fixing bugs
Any bugs detected in running this code can be submitted through Github pull requests. To do so, navigate to the Github repository page, find the main task bar button labeled 'Issues', and submit the problem occurring.
