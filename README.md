## Introduction
This project is focused on developing collaborative workflow skills through two exercises. The first goal was to create a concentration time series for the stream water chemistry data collected at four research sites at the Luquillo Experimental Forest. This data is collected by the Long Term Ecological Network and hosted by the Environmental Data Initiative. The data was read in, processed, and visualized on the Taylor server. The second goal was to ask and answer a question related to the data collected through the LTER. We decided to explore the relationship between rainfall and nutrient concentrations and total suspended solids using plots created by R. Our goal was to use data analysis to determine if there was a relationship between rainfall and stream nutrient concentration. 

To collaborate effectively, a Github repository was made and cloned to the Taylor Server at Bren. We used pair programming and worked together to find solutions to the answser the questions being asked by the partner that is coding. We also set up a Slack channel to share information. We each played a role in problem solving, documentation, coding, and project planning. 


## Installation
To succesfully repdroduce our project, access to the Taylor server at Bren is required. 

The R packages tidyverse, lubridate, and patchwork must be loaded before the code provided is used. 

Access to the data used in Part 1 can be found on the Environmental Data Initiative site here: McDowell, W. 2022. Chemistry of stream water from the Luquillo Mountains ver 4923058. Environmental Data Initiative. https://doi.org/10.6073/pasta/1dd1a59a7e6fbe95fdf8736477d81b83

Access to the data used in Part 2 can be found here: https://portal.edirepository.org/nis/metadataviewer?packageid=knb-lter-luq.148.1213961


## Usage
This project can be used in the future to monitor individual nutrient concentrations in any region, as long as the data is accessible. 

## Contribute 
Contributions to this project can be made through pull requests [here.](https://github.com/kiranfavre/eds214_group_project/pulls)

### Fixing bugs
Any bugs detected in the code can be submitted through Github's 'issues' feature [here.](https://github.com/kiranfavre/eds214_group_project/issues)
